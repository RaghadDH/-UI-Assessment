# Savvy Gaming Group – Tech UI Internship (2025)

## About the Project

This project is for the Savvy Gaming Group  Kickstarter Internship UI Technical Track. They gave me an image to recreate in Unity.

* I made **three buttons**:

  * Play
  * Settings
  * Quit
* I **cut the button images in Photoshop** and saved them as PNGs.
* The **background image** is from open sources.
* I used **Unity UI Canvas** to build everything.
* I added:

  * Hover effects
  * One idle animation for the Intro to Unity Ui Button that makes the buttons scale a bit  
* The UI works in portrait and landscape screens.

## How to Run

* Open the Unity project called `UI - Assessment` in Unity 2022.3 or newer.
* Open the scene file `MainScene.unity`.
* Press Play to test the UI.
